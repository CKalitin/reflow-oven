I need an FSM

State 1: Wait for button input
State 2: Pre heat
State 3: Soaking
State 4: Heat to reflow temp
State 5: Reflow
State 6: Cool down

Put all FSM functions in fsm.c

Create display and print .c files too

Printing:
- Temperature
- State
- Time since State 2 start

Python side, read each print, save to CSV with computer time. Save file with timestamp in file name

Display:
- Temperature
- State
- Time since State 2 start

Ok it's simple
